## Project Overview

***GoshGPT*** is a highly trained assistant that provides in-depth insights about the Gosh Blockchain and its ecosystem products. It answers queries with precision, making complex Gosh topics accessible to **newcomers, researchers, enthusiasts, and developers.** <br>

GoshGPT assists developers in building dapps on the Gosh Blockchain using the smart contract development, and Community to understand and get benefits from the Gosh Products through a conversational UI, powered by **OpenAI Assistants, GPT-4o model, and the latest tech-stack.** <br>

It helps developers code, fix, and test their smart contracts to build web3 applications on Gosh. Simply enter a prompt in the UI to get accurate answers. Specially designed for the Gosh community of developers and ecosystem products, GoshGPT was developed by Asharib Ali as a submission for the **"Coinstore Labs - Gosh Blockchain Ecosystem Hackathon 2024"** <br>

**GoshGPT** offers many great features to help developers & community to build, ship, and earn quickly on **Gosh Blockchain.** <br>

## Problem Statement with Solution

Developers want to build on Gosh but lack an interactive way to quickly and easily create full-stack web3 applications, and community want to understand the diverse products of Gosh. They might use ChatGPT, but it's trained on outdated data and doesn't know about the latest developments. Plus, GPT Plus costs $20 per month. That's why we need a platform/chatbot to address this issue: "Help developers write, fix, and test their smart contracts & Community to understand and get benefits from the Gosh Products for the Gosh Blockchain" in a conversational way. I have trained it on a massive amount of Gosh Ecosystem products data, and have prompt-engineered it to achieve the best results.

## Potential Integration

I have built two versions of the GoshGPT, both have the same functionalities but one chatbot fixes in the full viewport of the screen and the other one is the pop-up version, both have the same functionality and are built with the same APIs, these chatbots can-be integrated into anywhere either on the complete subdomain of official website or the docs website but with the popup version.

➡️ **[Prompt used for Assistant Training](./prompt-engineering/prompt.md)** <br>
➡️ **[Gosh Data used for Assistant Training](./data/)** <br>

## Future Improvements

**Expanded Knowledge Base:** Improve the ***GoshGPT*** by incorporating additional Gosh Blockchain resources data to provide more comprehensive and technical answers.<br>

**Enhance Community Analytics:** Access real-time community sentiment about the Gosh Blockchain and its ecosystem products through metrics from X and other social platforms for multiple use cases, such as in-depth technical, fundamental, and on-chain analysis of the $Gosh Coin<br>

**OnChain AI Swap:** Effortlessly swap your Gosh Coins and ecosystem tokens directly using a simple and intuitive prompt.
